# tasks2do
## tasks2do

**tasks2do** is a simple command-line task management app built with TypeScript and Node.js. It helps you organize and manage your tasks efficiently, allowing you to add, complete, remove, and view completed tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm**: You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

You can run the tasks2do app directly using the `npx` command. Follow the steps below:

1. **Open your terminal:** Open your terminal or command prompt. You can access the terminal on your computer based on your operating system (e.g., Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or a terminal emulator on Linux).

2. **Run tasks2do with npx:** In the terminal, use the following command to run tasks2do:

   ```
   npx tasks2do
   ```

   - If you've published tasks2do as a global npm package, this command will download and execute it directly.
   - If you're running it locally (without publishing), make sure you're in the directory where the `app.ts` file is located, or specify the full path to the `app.ts` file.

3. **Use the app:** After running the command, the tasks2do app will start, and you'll see a menu with various options for managing your tasks. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the app.

4. **Quit the app:** To exit the app, select the "Quit" option from the menu.
